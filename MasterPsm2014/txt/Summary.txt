Frameworks for Digital Audio : Theory and Applications

SUMMARY

Lesson 1

Computer Architecture 
	•	CPU, Execution flow: review of execution pointer, instruction
	•	Peripherals
	•	Device drivers, Interrupts
	•	Memory
	•	Multiprogrammed systems, preemption
	•	Multiprocessor Systems
	•	Multithreading

Computer programming
	•	Programming languages
	•	Compiled vs Interpreted
	•	Compilers
	•	Linkers
	•	Application Programmer Interfaces
	•	Unix conventions and file system
	•	Apple frameworks

Lesson 2, Audio Programming
Digital Audio
	•	Representation of sound
	•	ADCs, DACs
	•	Propeties of digital signals (quantization, sampling rate, Pope 346)
	•	Impact of transducers (see Pope)
	•	Representations and Formats for Media Data

Audio programming
	•	Types of APIs: conceptual layer including web audio, pure data, audio unit, 
	•	Levels of abstraction. show the relevant code in PD, web audio, supercollider
	•	Panorama of top level APIs
	•	Unit generators

Pure Data
	•	Example of sine
	•	MIDI example
	•	LibPD

Examples in C++

Lesson 3: iPhone and MacOS
	•	Audio unit
	•	Playing sounds in iOS

Lesson 4: WebAudio
	•	Introduction
	•	How it relates to unit generators
	•	Example scheduling
	•	Exercises
